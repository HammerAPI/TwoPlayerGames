# Two-Player Games

## Introduction

The first kind of two-player games we will consider work like this:

1. There are two players
2. The players alternate turns
3. Both players have the same set of legal moves
4. A player loses if they can not make a move

Chess violates Rule 3: I can not move your pieces, so I don't have the same moves as you.

Two-player graph coloring violates Rule 4. If the second player has no legal moves available, they still win (as long as the graph is not colored).

Nevertheless, this class of games makes a good starting point for our analysis.
