    "A branch of mathematics that supplies a variety of ways for analyzing situations where two or more players begin making decisions that are \"interdependent\". Each player is then forced because of this interdependence to choose their moves based on the moves made by the other player(s). A solution for a game would be the optimal strategy made that allowed a player to win (note: winning is determined based on each games rules). (Britannica).\n",

    "-   Determining political coalitions\n",
    "-   Determining Business conglomerates\n",

    "Evolutionary Game Theory originated when mathematicians started applying game theory to more biological ideas/contexts. A driving factor is the ability to collect information and then \"simulate learning\" based on the data collected. The better the previous times, the better the future plays. In order to avoid a complete deadlock though, the introduction slight variances where a player can \"mutate\" and make a slightly better or worse move allowing for a different outcome to happen.\n"

Whichever player removes the last toothpick from the table is declared the winner."

Something to note, however, is that this may not be true due to the size of the board and/or the nature of the game. The number of initial toothpicks may lead to a higher chance of winning for either player, and the game could be skewed to favor one player by design. To investigate this, a simple model can be made to predict the outcome of the game based on the existing data."

    "In response to the big question, there is in fact a way for a player to win every single time. If the player has prior knowledge to judge the move set off of, then they can \"counter\" the other player who is playing \"blindly\". Both of our models confirm this idea as the first one shows us about 50/50 split but once we introduced the idea of `player 1` having a \"knowledge bank\", then `player 2` no longer had a winning chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in our Future Work section, introducing some sort of \"mutability\" to the decisions that player make could offer better insight into an optimal strategy. Currently our understanding is that if there are 3 toothpicks on the table and its `player 2`'s turn, they will lose no matter what decision would be made (there will always be one or two toothpicks left for `player 1` to take)."
