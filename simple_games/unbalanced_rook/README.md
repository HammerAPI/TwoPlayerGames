# Unbalanced Rook

## Rules

The game starts with a tileboard of size `n` x `n` with a Rook at position (0,0), in the top-left of the tileboard. Players alternate moving the right any number of spaces either RIGHT or DOWN. Players cannot move two directions in the same turn and cannot move beyond the bounds of the board. The game ends when either a player submits an invalid move or the player moves the Rook to position (`n`,`n`).
