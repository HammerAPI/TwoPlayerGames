    "A ruleset is the set of rules that define how a game operates. Creating a ruleset involves implementing the required functions provided by the `RulesetInterface`. The functions consist of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__(name, initial_state, bounds = None)`: A constructor to setup the ruleset. A ruleset name (usually the game's name) must be provided. Additionally, the initial state of the game board must be specified. If necessary, the bounds of the game board may be provided. Think critically about what kind of board the game will need. For example, a game needing a tileboard needs bounds to determine its size.\n",
    "* `is_legal(board, proposed_move)`: Determines if the proposed move is legal given the current board state. This function does not need to know who made the move, as it only determines whether the move was legal or not. It **must** return either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "* `is_game_over(board)`: Determines if the game is over. This function must analyze the current state of the board to see if the end condition has been met. If the board is in an end state, the game is over. This function **must** return either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "* `update_board(board, player, move)`: Updates the board to reflect the move made. Also updates the board's move history logger, which is by default `board.data`. The index of the move history should be a stringified representation of the board's state and the value at that index should be a tuple containing the player's name and the move made."
