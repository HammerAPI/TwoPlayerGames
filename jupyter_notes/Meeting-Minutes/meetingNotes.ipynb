    "Issue: Toothpick takeaway strategy was always the same move set of {1,2} whereas in UR the piece is on an (x,y) coordinate. To develop strategies for UR in a similar way as previously, the input will be a position on the grid (x,y) and the output will be a direction (down or right) followed by number of spaces. For example: input(3,2), output(d,4) with (0,0) being in the top left corner.\n",

    "   - 3) Track the winner of each game\n",
    "   - 4) Keep player with a set win rate(~60%-80%?) or above and remove those below the threshold\n",

    "   - A splice funciton that will take random pieces of the parent's strategy(coin flip) for each move and make the strategy that way. Include random mutation that will change one piece of a strategy output to increasy diversity in strategies.\n",

    "- each game has a notebook in the directory explaining how to implement runa nd collect data on a game.\n",
    "- The README files contain what the game is, an example game, definitions of the board, moveset, etc.\n",
    "- There is an overview notebook containing our process and some findings of last semester's research which can be used to create a final writup of the research or added onto for research with unbalanced rook\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas/Notes: \n",
    "- For the check functions (to see when game is finished0 include an example of a legal and illegal move, along with what makes the game end. This will make it easier to write unit tests.\n",
    "- Students dont often see the importance of abstraction, as it can complicate things for some students\n",
    "    - But fighting through the difficult abstracting tasks will make future pieces fit together easier and make them easier to understand.\n",
    "    - Advice: the difference in understand how to abstract can cause conflict in ideas and methods, which is not inherently bad but may cause some frustration\n",
    "- all function in the code should include data types for parameters and returns in the docstrings, along w examples if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests:\n",
    "- Keep a record of signifcant challenges and how we solved them for refrence in the future\n",
    "    - include anything significant, but the problem should not be that person A wrote bad code\n",
    "    - even something as simple as miscommunication should be included and how we resolve the issue.\n",
    "    - i.e problem: the definition of abstraction from the view of cs and math.\n",
    "    - solution: clearly define what abstraction means in this situation and how far to take it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weeks goals:\n",
    "- Submit the abstract, make sure that we are underpromising on it. better to say less and give more.\n",
    "- csv writer by next meeting 2/19/21. attempt to make a generic one\n",
    "    - may be better to create a csv writer for each game because different pieces of each move is needed. \n",
    "- Penland should email by tuesday 2/16/21 about how to generate the population of players.\n"
