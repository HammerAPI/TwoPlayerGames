    "Issue: Toothpick takeaway strategy was always the same move set of {1,2} whereas in UR the piece is on an (x,y) coordinate. To develop strategies for UR in a similar way as previously, the input will be a position on the grid (x,y) and the output will be a direction (down or right) followed by number of spaces. For example: input(3,2), output(d,4) with (0,0) being in the top left corner.\n",
