    "*Toothpick Takeaway* is a simple two-player game involving a number of toothpicks on the table (in our case, 10) and two players alternating picking them up. Each player has the ability to pick up one or two toothpicks on his or her turn. Whoever picks up the last toothpick wins"

    "1. There are 10 toothpicks on a table. \n",
    "2. The two players alternate taking toothpicks off the table. \n",
    "3. At each turn, the player may take either 1 or 2 toothpicks.\n",
    "4. If a player can not make a legal move, that player loses. This includes the situation where the table is left empty by the previous player's move."
